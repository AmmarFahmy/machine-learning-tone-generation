# Machine Learning Tone Generation
I plan on using GANs to make believeable instrument tone audio.

Got the audio into a 2d array that a net could be used on, found way to plot spectrogram for visualization

Finished all linear algrebra jupyter notebooks, 3 multivariable notebooks; need to finish 1-2 multivariable notebooks

Looked at the GAN websites Mr. Writer shared; definitely would help with the more nitty-gritty of GAN implementation, especially DCGANs

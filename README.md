# Machine Learning Tone Generation
I plan on using GANs to make believeable instrument tone audio.

Got the audio into a 2d array of complex numbers processed by Fourier transform, found way to plot spectrogram for visualization

Finished linear algebra and multivariable calculus courses on Coursera (completed all quizzes to 100% and notebooks)

Things to look at:
 - Courses for contract proposal
 - Log-mel spectrogram

Important read articles:
 - CNN classification of spectrograms
 - DCGAN

Emailed primary author of CNN timbre analysis spectrograms; he pointed me to log-mel spectrograms and the GitHub code (https://github.com/jordipons/EUSIPCO2017)
